# Autonomous_robotic_cell
Autonomous robotic cell With vision and Robodk Simulation based on the object detection &amp; path planning
The syestem develop to automatically detect the object on the work space & add user can provide the relavant operation of robot like (pick, place, etc), accordingly the system will generate the coordinate for robot & send pose 
The system having option to taught the new position into Robodk for future.
